Web: Many frameworks is referenced in the project including:
     Automapper for automatic mapping of Models and ViewModels whenever the presentation of data is different from the Model behind it.
	  or when we need different presentations for a model.
	 Logs folder contains the log files which will be generated by NLog.
	 There are some ModelBinders in the project, they will convert the inputs to nice classes e.g. AttachmentModelBinder.
	 As expected Controllers and Views are defined here.
